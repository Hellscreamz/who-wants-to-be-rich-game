Everything is almost the same as you know the game, but we have 2 exceptions:

1. You only have one joker - 50/50, you can use it 3 times and you can only do it on questions with more than 2 answers!
2. You can leave the game and take the money, but you can only do so after answering the question, you can not leave the game while in question.


P.S For Rule 2

I decide to do it this way, because if I create a real game with real money in a real situation, it will be a better algorithm, because most people are greedy.
And they will decide to try another question for more money, but it's actually a trap because the questions get harder, you probably don't have jokers anymore and you're about to face your bad decisions.

You know - the casino always wins. ;)
